# üîç FlashFusion User Research Strategy
## Applying Research Frameworks to AI Business Automation

## üéØ Target Market Research Framework Application

### **AI Developers & Automation Specialists**

#### **Primary Framework: Decision-Driven Research + Behavioral Analysis**
**Problem Statement**: "I spend more time debugging AI prompts than building actual products"

**Research Questions**:
- What specific debugging tasks consume the most time?
- Where do developers get stuck in the AI workflow?
- What tools do they currently use and why do those tools fail?

**Framework Application**:
```
Jobs to Be Done Analysis:
- Situation: "When I'm integrating multiple AI services..."
- Job: "I want to orchestrate them seamlessly..."
- Outcome: "So I can focus on business logic instead of API management"

Behavioral Research:
- Analytics: Track time spent on different development tasks
- Session recordings: Watch developers work through AI integration
- A/B testing: Compare assisted vs. manual AI orchestration
```

**Interview Script Template**:
```
Act 1 - Welcome (2 min):
"Thanks for taking time to talk about your AI development experience"

Act 2 - Context (5 min):
"Tell me about your current role and how you use AI in your projects"

Act 3 - Introduction (3 min):
"I'd like to understand your workflow when building AI-powered applications"

Act 4 - Detail (30 min):
"Walk me through your last AI project from start to finish"
- "Where did you get stuck?"
- "What took longer than expected?"
- "What tools did you use and why?"
- "If you had a magic wand, what would you automate?"

Act 5 - Closing (5 min):
"What would make you 10x more productive in AI development?"
```

### **E-commerce Sellers & Entrepreneurs**

#### **Primary Framework: User Journey Mapping + HEART Metrics**
**Problem Statement**: "I spend 15+ hours/week manually updating listings across platforms"

**Research Questions**:
- What's the complete multi-platform selling journey?
- Which steps cause the most frustration?
- What would high-value automation look like?

**Framework Application**:
```
User Journey Mapping:
Stage 1: Product Research ‚Üí Actions, Thoughts, Emotions, Pain Points
Stage 2: Listing Creation ‚Üí Manual work, platform differences
Stage 3: Inventory Management ‚Üí Sync failures, overselling risks
Stage 4: Customer Service ‚Üí Repetitive questions, platform switching
Stage 5: Analytics Review ‚Üí Scattered data, manual reporting

HEART Metrics:
- Happiness: NPS for platform management experience
- Engagement: Hours saved per week through automation
- Adoption: Number of platforms connected
- Retention: Monthly active sellers using automation
- Task Success: Percentage of successful cross-platform syncs
```

**Interview Script Template**:
```
Empathy Mapping Focus:
- Says: "Managing inventory across 5 platforms is a nightmare"
- Thinks: "There has to be a better way to do this"
- Does: Manually updates each platform, checks for errors
- Feels: Frustrated, overwhelmed, worried about mistakes

Journey Mapping Questions:
"Walk me through updating a product across all your platforms"
"What happens when something goes wrong?"
"How do you know if inventory is synced correctly?"
"What's your biggest fear with multi-platform selling?"
```

### **Content Creators & Digital Marketers**

#### **Primary Framework: Mental Models + Continuous Research**
**Problem Statement**: "Creating content for multiple platforms feels like doing the same work 5 times"

**Research Questions**:
- How do creators think about content adaptation?
- What's their mental model for platform optimization?
- Where does the repurposing process break down?

**Framework Application**:
```
Mental Models Analysis:
Creator's Model: "One idea ‚Üí Multiple formats ‚Üí Platform posting"
Current Reality: "One idea ‚Üí Manual recreation ‚Üí Individual optimization ‚Üí Separate posting"
Ideal Model: "One idea ‚Üí Automated adaptation ‚Üí Smart distribution"

Continuous Research Cycle:
Discovery: Weekly creator interviews about workflow pain points
Delivery: Prototype testing during content creation
Post-launch: Usage analytics and satisfaction tracking
```

**Interview Script Template**:
```
Mental Models Deep Dive:
"Describe your ideal content creation workflow"
"How do you decide what content works on which platform?"
"Walk me through adapting a blog post for TikTok"
"What's the most time-consuming part of content repurposing?"

Diary Study Prompts:
- Day 1: "Document your content creation process today"
- Day 3: "Note any frustrations with platform requirements"
- Day 7: "Rate your satisfaction with content performance"
```
