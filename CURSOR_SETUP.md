```

### 2. Styling Assistance
```
You: "Make this component responsive and add hover effects"
AI: Adds media queries and CSS transitions
```

### 3. Bug Fixing
```
You: "This component isn't rendering correctly on mobile"
AI: Analyzes code and suggests fixes
```

### 4. Performance Optimization
```
You: "Optimize this component for better performance"
AI: Suggests React.memo, useMemo, or other optimizations
```

## üîß FlashFusion Development Tips

### Smart Code Generation
- Use **Ctrl+K** to generate entire page components
- Ask AI to create responsive CSS Grid layouts
- Generate TypeScript interfaces from existing props

### Code Refactoring
- Select code and use **Ctrl+I** to refactor
- Ask AI to split large components into smaller ones
- Convert inline styles to CSS modules

### Documentation
- Generate JSDoc comments automatically
- Create README sections for new features
- Generate API documentation

## üé® UI Development with AI

### Design Pattern Recognition
Cursor can help with FlashFusion's design patterns:

```
"Create a feature card component matching the existing design system"
"Add a new dashboard widget with the same styling patterns"
"Generate a form component with validation using our theme colors"
```

### Animation Creation
```
"Add smooth transitions to this component"
"Create a hover animation for the feature cards"
"Implement loading states with CSS animations"
```

## üöÄ Deployment Assistance

### Build Optimization
```
"Analyze the bundle size and suggest optimizations"
"Add code splitting for better performance"
"Configure Vite for production deployment"
```

### Environment Setup
```
"Help me configure environment variables for production"
"Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment"
"Create Docker configuration for this app"
```

## üîç Debugging with AI

### Error Analysis
- Paste error messages and get instant explanations
- AI can identify common React pitfalls
- Get suggestions for fixing build issues

### Performance Profiling
```
"Why is this component re-rendering so often?"
"How can I optimize the bundle size?"
"What's causing the layout shift in mobile view?"
```

## üìã Keyboard Shortcuts
