# Security Briefing - FlashFusion Development

**SECURITY CLASSIFICATION**: Restricted  
**PROJECT**: FlashFusion-Unified AI Business Platform  
**CLEARANCE LEVEL**: Development Team Only

## üîí Current Security Context

You are now operating under **ENTERPRISE SECURITY PROTOCOLS**. All operations require explicit human approval.

### Critical Security Rules (MANDATORY)
1. **NO AUTO-APPROVALS**: Every file change requires human confirmation
2. **EXPLICIT PERMISSIONS**: Request specific permissions for each operation
3. **AUDIT EVERYTHING**: All operations are logged and monitored  
4. **MINIMAL SCOPE**: Use least privilege principle for all requests
5. **VERIFY BEFORE EXECUTE**: Confirm intentions before any system changes

## üõ°Ô∏è Authorized Operations

### ‚úÖ Currently Approved (Low Risk)
- **Read**: Code analysis and file reading
- **Grep**: Search operations within codebase  
- **LS**: Directory listing and file discovery
- **Glob**: Pattern-based file searching

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Explicit Approval (Medium Risk)
- **Write**: Creating new files
- **Edit**: Modifying existing files
- **MultiEdit**: Batch file modifications

### üö® High Security Operations (Requires Justification)
- **Bash**: System command execution
- **Task**: External agent operations
- **WebFetch**: External network access

## üîê Protected Assets (DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT APPROVAL)

### Tier 1: Critical Security Assets
- `.env*` - Environment variables and API keys
- `package.json` - Dependency definitions
- `docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure configuration
- `.claude/config.json` - Security settings
- `database/` - Database schemas and migrations

### Tier 2: Business Logic Protection
- `src/core/` - Core business orchestration
- `src/services/` - Business services
- `api/` - API endpoint definitions
- `scripts/` - Automation and deployment

### Tier 3: Development Configuration
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- `firebase.json` - Firebase project settings

## üö® Security Protocols

### Before Any Operation:
1. **State your intention** clearly
2. **Identify files/systems** that will be affected
3. **Request specific permissions** for the operation
4. **Wait for explicit human approval**
5. **Proceed only after confirmation**

### During Operations:
1. **Stay within approved scope**
2. **Report any unexpected findings**
3. **Ask before expanding operation scope**
4. **Provide progress updates**
5. **Verify results before completion**

### After Operations:
1. **Confirm intended changes only**
2. **Report any side effects**
3. **Recommend next steps**
4. **Update security audit log**

## üéØ Secure Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis (Read-Only)
```
Permission Request: "Read", "Grep", "LS", "Glob"
Purpose: Code analysis and understanding
Risk Level: Low
Human Approval: Auto-approved for analysis
```

### Phase 2: Planning (Analysis + Documentation)
```
Permission Request: "Read", "Grep", "LS", "Write"
Purpose: Create implementation plans and documentation
Risk Level: Medium
Human Approval: Required for any file creation
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (Controlled Changes)
```
Permission Request: "Read", "Edit", specific files only
Purpose: Implement planned changes
Risk Level: Medium-High
Human Approval: Required for each file modification
```

### Phase 4: Testing (System Operations)
```
Permission Request: "Read", "Bash(npm run test)"
Purpose: Execute approved testing commands
Risk Level: High
Human Approval: Required with command justification
```

## üîç Current Session Security Status
