## üö® Secure Claude Code Usage

### Recommended Security Configuration

#### Never Use (Security Violations):
```bash
# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Bypasses all security controls
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Too broad permissions
claude --allowedTools "*"
```

#### Secure Usage Patterns:

```bash
# ‚úÖ SECURE - Minimal permissions for analysis
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS" "Glob"

# ‚úÖ SECURE - Specific write permissions when needed
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS" "Edit" --files "src/components/NewFeature.tsx"

# ‚úÖ SECURE - Restricted command execution
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Bash(npm run test)" --confirmBeforeRun
```

### Permission Escalation Protocol

#### Level 1: Read-Only Operations
```bash
# Start every session with minimal permissions
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS" "Glob"

# Purpose: Code analysis, understanding, planning
# Risk: Minimal - no system modifications possible
# Approval: Auto-approved
```

#### Level 2: File Modification Operations  
```bash
# Request specific file modification permissions
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS" "Edit"

# Purpose: Implement planned changes
# Risk: Medium - code modifications possible
# Approval: Explicit human approval required
# Documentation: Change summary must be provided
```

#### Level 3: System Operations
```bash
# Request system command permissions with restrictions
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Bash(npm run test)" "Bash(git status)"

# Purpose: Testing, validation, git operations
# Risk: High - system state changes possible
# Approval: Explicit approval + justification required
# Monitoring: Real-time command monitoring
```

## üîê Asset Protection Framework

### Sensitive File Protection

#### Tier 1: Never Allow AI Direct Access
```
Production Secrets:
- .env.production
- .env.staging  
- *.key, *.pem, *.p12
- config/secrets/*
- kubernetes/secrets.yaml

Database Assets:
- database/backups/*
- migrations/production/*
- *.sql containing real data

Infrastructure:
- docker-compose.prod.yml
- terraform/*.tf
- ansible/production/*
```

**Protocol**: Human-only access. AI can analyze sanitized versions only.

#### Tier 2: AI Access with Explicit Approval
```
Development Configuration:
- package.json
- docker-compose.yml
- .env.development
- webpack.config.js
- vite.config.ts

Core Business Logic:
- src/core/
- src/services/
- api/routes/
- database/schemas/

Deployment Configuration:
- vercel.json
- firebase.json
- .github/workflows/
```

**Protocol**: AI can read with approval. Modifications require detailed justification and human review.

#### Tier 3: Standard Protection
```
Application Code:
- src/components/
- src/utils/
- src/hooks/
- tests/

Documentation:
- docs/
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md

Development Tools:
- scripts/development/
- .eslintrc.js
- .prettierrc
```

**Protocol**: AI can read freely. Modifications require standard approval process.

### Directory Access Control Matrix

| Directory | Read | Write | Execute | Justification Required |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| `.env*` | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Always |
| `database/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Always |
| `src/core/` | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå | For modifications |
| `api/` | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚ùå | For modifications |
| `docs/` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Never |
| `tests/` | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | For test execution |
| `.github/` | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Always |

**Legend**: ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Approval | ‚ùå Forbidden

## üö® Security Workflows

### Secure Session Initialization

#### Pre-Session Security Checklist
```bash
# 1. Verify secure working directory
pwd
# Must be: /c/FlashFusion-Unified/FlashFusion-Unified

# 2. Confirm clean git state
git status
# No uncommitted sensitive files

# 3. Check for sensitive files in working directory  
find . -name "*.key" -o -name ".env*" -o -name "*.pem"
# Verify no unprotected secrets

# 4. Validate environment isolation
echo $NODE_ENV
# Must be: development

# 5. Initialize security audit log
echo "SESSION START: $(date) - User: $(whoami)" >> .claude/audit.log
```

#### Secure Claude Code Session Start
```bash
# Initialize with minimal permissions
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS" "Glob" \
       --auditLog ".claude/audit.log" \
       --sessionTimeout 7200 \
       --requireConfirmation

# Load security briefing

## üîç Security Monitoring & Auditing

### Real-Time Monitoring

#### Session Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
# Monitor Claude operations in real-time
tail -f .claude/audit.log | grep -E "(WRITE|EXECUTE|BASH)"

# Watch for unauthorized file access attempts
inotifywait -m -r --format '%w%f %e' src/ api/ database/ .env*

# Monitor system resource usage during AI operations
watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep claude'
```

#### Automated Security Alerts
```bash
# Alert on sensitive file access
if grep -q "\.env\|\.key\|\.pem" .claude/audit.log; then
    echo "SECURITY ALERT: Sensitive file access detected" | \
    mail -s "Claude Security Alert" security@flashfusion.co
fi

# Alert on unauthorized command execution
if grep -qE "rm -rf|sudo|chmod 777" .claude/audit.log; then
    echo "SECURITY ALERT: Dangerous command detected" | \
    mail -s "Claude Security Alert" security@flashfusion.co
fi
```

### Audit Log Analysis

#### Daily Security Review
```bash
# Generate daily security report
npm run security-report

# Analyze permission usage patterns
grep -E "PERMISSION|APPROVAL" .claude/audit.log | \
    awk '{print $1, $2, $4}' | sort | uniq -c

# Review file access patterns
grep -E "READ|WRITE|EDIT" .claude/audit.log | \
    cut -d' ' -f3- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Check for security violations
grep -E "VIOLATION|DENIED|BLOCKED" .claude/audit.log
```

#### Weekly Security Assessment
```bash
# Comprehensive security scan
npm run security-scan

# Dependency vulnerability assessment
npm audit --audit-level high

# Code security analysis
npm run static-security-analysis

# Infrastructure security review
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src clair:latest scan /src
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Secure Development Patterns

### Security-First Feature Development

#### Phase 1: Security Planning
```bash
# Start with security-focused analysis
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep" "LS"

# Security-focused prompts:
"Analyze the authentication system for security vulnerabilities"
"Review input validation patterns in the API layer"
"Assess the security implications of adding [feature]"
```

#### Phase 2: Threat Modeling
```bash
# Security threat analysis
"Create a threat model for the [feature] including:
- Attack vectors and entry points
- Data flow security analysis  
- Trust boundaries and validation points
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Recommended security controls"
```

#### Phase 3: Secure Implementation
```bash
# Request implementation permissions with security focus
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Edit" --files "specific-files-only"

# Security-focused implementation:
"Implement [feature] with the following security requirements:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding and XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Secure error handling without information disclosure"
```

#### Phase 4: Security Testing
```bash
# Security testing permissions
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Bash(npm run security-test)"

# Security-focused testing:
"Execute security test suite focusing on:
- Input validation bypass attempts
- Authentication and authorization testing
- SQL injection and XSS testing  
- Rate limiting validation
- Error handling security analysis"
```

### Secure Code Review Process

#### AI-Assisted Security Review
```bash
# Security-focused code review
claude --allowedTools "Read" "Grep"

# Security review prompt:
/review-security

"Perform comprehensive security review of recent changes:
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding and XSS prevention
- SQL injection prevention measures
- Error handling security implications
- Logging security considerations
- Dependency security analysis"
```
