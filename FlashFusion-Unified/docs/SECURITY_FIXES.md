# Security Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security fixes applied to address all identified vulnerabilities in the Supabase database configuration.

## 🚨 Issues Addressed

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Issues
- **11 tables** had RLS policies allowing anonymous access
- **Solution**: Removed permissive policies and implemented strict authentication-based access control

### Authentication Configuration Issues
- **OTP Expiry**: Exceeded recommended threshold
- **Leaked Password Protection**: Disabled
- **Solution**: Provided configuration guidelines and enhanced security measures

## 📊 Fixed Tables

| Table | Issue | Fix Applied |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `order_items` | Anonymous access | User can only access their own order items |
| `orders` | Anonymous access | User can only access their own orders |
| `platform_products` | Anonymous access | Authenticated users can view, admins can modify |
| `products` | Anonymous access | Users see published products or own store products |
| `profiles` | Anonymous access | Users can only access their own profile |
| `stores` | Anonymous access | Users see active stores or own stores |
| `study_sessions` | Anonymous access | Users can only access their own sessions |
| `user_activity` | Anonymous access | Users can only access their own activity |
| `user_favorites` | Anonymous access | Users can only access their own favorites |
| `user_preferences` | Anonymous access | Users can only access their own preferences |
| `user_roles` | Anonymous access | Users see own roles, admins manage all roles |

## 🔒 Security Policy Framework

### Core Principles
1. **Authentication Required**: All access requires valid JWT token (`auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`)
2. **User Ownership**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Role-Based Access**: Admin roles have elevated permissions
4. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions granted

### Policy Types Implemented

#### User Data Access
```sql
-- Example: Users can view their own data
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND user_id = auth.uid())
```

#### Store/Business Logic
```sql
-- Example: Store owners can manage their products
USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.stores 
    WHERE stores.id = products.store_id 
    AND stores.owner_id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```

#### Admin-Only Access
```sql
-- Example: Only admins can manage user roles
USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.user_roles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND role = 'admin'
  )
)
```

## 🛡️ Enhanced Security Features

### 1. Helper Functions
- `auth.is_admin()` - Check admin status
- `auth.owns_store(store_id)` - Check store ownership
- `auth.validate_password_strength(password)` - Validate password requirements
- `auth.is_rate_limited(user_id, endpoint)` - Check rate limiting

### 2. Security Monitoring
- `security_events` table - Track failed logins, suspicious activity
- `content_moderation_rules` - Enhanced content filtering
- `audit_log` - Complete audit trail for all data changes

### 3. Rate Limiting Enhancements
- Per-user rate limiting with configurable limits
- Temporary blocking for repeat offenders
- Security level escalation (normal/elevated/high)

### 4. Content Security
- Comprehensive blocked words list
- Pattern matching for suspicious content
- Severity-based actions (block/flag/moderate)

## 📋 Manual Configuration Required

### 1. OTP Expiry Settings
Navigate to: **Authentication > Settings > Auth**

```
Email OTP expiry: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
SMS OTP expiry: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Phone OTP expiry: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
```

### 2. Password Security
Navigate to: **Authentication > Settings > Auth**

```
✅ Enable leaked password protection
✅ Minimum length: 8 characters
✅ Require uppercase letters
✅ Require lowercase letters
✅ Require numbers
✅ Require special characters
```

### 3. Additional Auth Settings
```
✅ Confirm email change
✅ Secure email change
JWT expiry limit: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
✅ Refresh token rotation
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Changes
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/apply-security-fixes.sh

# Set environment variable
export SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=your-project-ref

# Run security fixes
./scripts/apply-security-fixes.sh
```

### 2. Manual Dashboard Configuration
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication > Settings
3. Apply the configuration changes listed above
4. Save all settings

### 3. Verification
Run these queries in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check security policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- View security dashboard (admin only)
SELECT * FROM public.security_dashboard;
```

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Dashboard Views
- `security_status` - Overview of security configuration
- `security_dashboard` - Real-time security metrics

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts (24h)
- Content violations (24h)
- Rate limited users
- Active user sessions

### Audit Queries
```sql
-- Failed login attempts
SELECT * FROM public.security_events 
WHERE event_type = 'failed_login' 
AND created_at > now() - interval '24 hours';

-- Content violations
SELECT violation_terms, COUNT(*) 
FROM public.content_violations 
GROUP BY violation_terms 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Rate limiting status
SELECT user_id, endpoint, request_count, blocked_until
FROM public.api_rate_limits 
WHERE blocked_until > now();
```

## ✅ Testing Your Application

### 1. Anonymous Access Test
Try accessing your application without authentication - should be blocked.

### 2. User Data Isolation Test
- Login as User A
- Verify you cannot access User B's data
- Test all major data operations

### 3. Role-Based Access Test
- Test admin functions require admin role
- Verify regular users cannot access admin features

### 4. Rate Limiting Test
- Make rapid API requests
- Verify rate limiting kicks in
- Check blocked status

## 🎯 Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

✅ **All RLS policy warnings resolved**  
✅ **Anonymous access completely blocked**  
✅ **OTP expiry within recommended limits**  
✅ **Leaked password protection enabled**  
✅ **Enhanced security monitoring in place**  
✅ **Comprehensive audit logging active**  

## 🔄 Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review security event logs
