## Recent Changes

### August 2, 2025 - Complete Security Vulnerability Remediation
- **Fixed critical XSS vulnerabilities**: Replaced ALL unsafe `innerHTML` usage with secure DOM methods in `api/index.js` (lines 439, 461, 482)
- **Security improvements**: Eliminated all remaining `innerHTML` usage by using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent` for HTML structure creation
- **Functions secured**: `createAgent()`, `createWorkflow()`, and `addIntegration()` functions now create DOM elements safely
- **Impact**: Removed all XSS attack vectors while maintaining identical functionality and visual appearance
- **Previous fixes confirmed**: `client/dist/agents.js` and other files already properly secured
- **Command injection review**: Verified `spawn()` usage in `start-dev.js` is secure with hardcoded commands and controlled arguments
- **API key audit**: Confirmed no hardcoded API keys in codebase - all references are in documentation templates

### January 30, 2025 - Critical Security Vulnerability Patches Applied
- **Fixed multiple XSS vulnerabilities**: Replaced unsafe `innerHTML` usage with secure DOM methods in legacy files
- **Files patched**: `client/dist/agents.js` and `client/dist/dashboard-interactive.js`
- **Security improvements**: All user-controlled data now safely handled using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent`
- **Functions secured**: `displayAgents()`, `showAgentDetails()`, `chatWithAgent()`, `sendMessage()`, `displayCodeSnippets()`, `runCode()`, `shareCode()`
- **Impact**: Eliminated all script injection vectors while maintaining full functionality

### January 29, 2025 - Complete Full-Stack Application Built
- **Built comprehensive authentication system**: Implemented secure Replit Auth with session management and PostgreSQL storage
- **Created real-time chat functionality**: WebSocket-based chat system with user-to-user messaging
- **Integrated SMS messaging**: Twilio API integration for sending SMS messages with status tracking
- **Implemented Stripe payments**: Full subscription management with payment processing
- **Developed React frontend**: Modern responsive UI with Landing, Home, Chat, SMS, and Subscription pages
- **Established database schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with users, chats, messages, and SMS tables

### Key Components Built
- `server/`: Complete Express backend with authentication, WebSocket, and API routes
- `client/`: React frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- `shared/schema.ts`: Drizzle ORM schema with proper relations and validation
- Database tables: users, sessions, chats, chat_participants, messages, sms_messages
- All core features working: auth, chat, SMS, payments, responsive UI

## Project Architecture

### Core Services
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with secure session management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket server for instant messaging between users
- **SMS Service**: Twilio integration for SMS messaging capabilities
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components

### Environment Handling
- **Production**: Strict validation for JWT_SECRET, graceful database fallback
- **Development**: Flexible configuration with helpful suggestions
- **Deployment**: Comprehensive validation with detailed error messages

### Security
- JWT_SECRET required in production (auto-generated for development)
- Environment validation prevents deployment with missing critical secrets
- Graceful degradation for optional services

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Technical and concise
- **Error Handling**: Provide specific solutions for each error
- **Deployment**: Prioritize reliability and clear error messages
- **Architecture**: Maintain backward compatibility with graceful fallbacks

## Development Guidelines
- Follow the fullstack_js development guidelines
- Use environment validation before making configuration changes
- Test both online and offline modes for database features
- Provide helpful error messages with specific solutions
